# 2. Project Details

**Background**: This hotel booking dataset allows professionals to answer different questions related to the industry, like the best time of year to book a hotel room, the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate, or to predict whether or not a hotel is likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests.

**Objective**: The task is to build a model that will predict the cancelations of the hote bookings in order to have a better understanding of the future demand for the hotel managers as well as a more accurate forecasting of the different services needed to provide those bookings. On the other hand, to create a complete dashboard that allows to have a clear understanding of the booking dataset that both hotels have.

**Data**: The dataset consists of information on some 119,390 bookings registrations. The dataset consisted of historic transactions between 2015 and 2017. The variable to predict will be 'is_canceled'.
